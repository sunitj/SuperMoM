# SuperMoM
This repo hosts the **Super** *(awesome)* **M**eta-**o**mics **M**iner tool. 

## What is SuperMoM?

### Summary
Suite of scripts (mostly in R and Perl) to parse, load and analyze Meta*omics data using a Graph database (Neo4j).

=====
#**WARNING:** 

* The code is no where near a stable release and is missing substantial portions of the suite.
* The documentation is more like scribbles of the ideas in my head and probably won't make any sense unless you get in touch.
* Please do get in touch if you were intrigued.
